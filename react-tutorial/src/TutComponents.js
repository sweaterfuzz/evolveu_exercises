// ------------- COMPONENTS ----------------- //

/* 
Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept 
arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements 
describing what should appear on the screen. Components let you 
split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about 
each piece in isolation.

Convention: Always start component names with a capital letter.

Props are read-only; shouldn't be modified inside functions.

State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled 
by the component. A state can be controlled if the component is 
defined as a class.
